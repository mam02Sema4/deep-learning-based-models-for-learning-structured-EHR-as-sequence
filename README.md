> develop deep learning-based models for learning structured EHR as sequence

## TLSTM
- this is a PyTorch implementation of TLSTM published in Patient Subtyping via Time-Aware LSTM Networks", KDD, 2017
- the implementation was validated using the sync data released in the original TLSTM repo. 
- The results we got on train is AUC of 0.958 and test is AUC of 0.916
